## Inspiration

Meet Got’ya and never lost anything that matters.

As your passport matters, so is the time during Hajj and you would never want to waste it finding group mates / friends and family.

## What it does

**Meet Got’ya**. The tiny Bluetooth wrist band tracker and easy-to-use app that helps you find your group / maktab mate and everyday belonging quickly.
You can notify each and every member of your group that you lost them and can track them in real time with **1 ft. precision.**

It will work on big data to create heat maps so that authorities can investigate the routes and 
design the paths and constructions according to the data.

It will be showing push notifications from the authorities, temperature, humidity level, emergency contact numbers and peer to peer text communication.



_ How it works _

With Got'ya, finding your group mates along with your belongings i.e. passport, bag etc.  is a matter of minute.

If you have lost track of your group mates or any belongings, Just tap a button on the wrist band, it will generate a notification on group member’s smart phones and vibrate their wrist band. It will show them your exact location by 1 ft. precision and vice versa by showing their last known location if not any device is around.
 
It will also generate push notifications and alerts. If the Got’ya chip is attached to a passport, it will notify immediately if the passport is dropped and the wristband will start vibrating.
 
It work on these simple steps.
1.    **Attach Got’ya**
Wear wrist band, Stick, slide or hook Got’ya to your wallets, passport and more.
 
2.    **See it. Ring it. Vibrate it. Find it.
See the last place you had your friend / group member / family on a map and make it ring when you get close.
 
3.    **Find them**
Double tap the Wristband button / tracker button to make their smart phone ring.


## How we built it

**Wrist band and tracker**

We incorporated world’s latest technology; **BLE** (Bluetooth Low Energy) devices which have years of battery backup and very small in size.

It communicates with the mobile app sharing the proximity distance from the mobile leaving the last known location when it was near phone and continuously showing on google map.

We made the algorithm so that all these devices can communicate to each other giving the exact location to the sender’s or receiver’s mobile who’s far away. For example, if your device will communicate to the person having that app near you, and that will communicate to the next till it reaches the one who requested the location and will happen in seconds.

BLE consumes very less battery leaving the device active for months and even years.

**Mobile App**

We are using Java and React-native to build the app. It will communicate over Bluetooth and uses the proximity sensors, GPS sensors and Internet modules to give 1 ft. precision.

## Challenges we ran into

1.    **Meeting 1 ft. proximity precision for finding belongings and group fellow was challenging.

2.    Making BLE (low energy Bluetooth devices) working in mesh network to make them able to communicate with each other.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

1.    You’ll get the notification the moment you lost your passport.

2.    It is a millisecond job to notify and share your location to your group mate when you lost them.

3.    Group people can track any of their members.

4. BLE devices have battery lasting for more than years. you don’t need to charge them.


## What we learned
 During the development, our focus was to analyse and create mesh network for the device communication, so learning that was a challenge.
Working in this much crowd was an experience in itself.

## What's next for K-049 - Got’ya.
We want to be the ultimate and required device for the every Hajj pilgrim.
